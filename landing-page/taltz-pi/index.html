                <p>TALTZ (ixekizumab (rch)) is a humanised immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal
                    antibody (mAb) with neutralising activity against interleukin-17A (IL-17A). TALTZ is
                    produced by recombinant DNA technology in a recombinant mammalian cell line and
                    purified using standard technology for bioprocessing. Ixekizumab is comprised of two
                    identical light chain polypeptides of 219 amino acids each and two identical heavy chain
                    polypeptides of 445 amino acids each.</p>

                <h4 id="Therapeutic_indications">4.1 Therapeutic indications </h4>
                <p><b>Plaque psoriasis</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque
                    psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy</p>
                <p><b>Psoriatic arthritis</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have
                    responded inadequately, or who are intolerant, to previous DMARD therapy.</p>
                <p>TALTZ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with a conventional DMARD (e.g.
                    methotrexate).</p>

                <h4 id="Dose_and_method_of_administration">4.2 Dose and method of administration </h4>

                <p><b>Dosage</b></p>
                <p><b>Plaque psoriasis</b></p>
                <p>The recommended dose is 160 mg by SC injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, followed
                    by an 80 mg injection (one injection) every 2 weeks at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, then 80 mg
                    (one injection) every 4 weeks.</p>
                <p><b>Psoriatic arthritis</b></p>
                <p>The recommended dose is 160 mg by SC injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, followed
                    by 80 mg (one injection) every 4 weeks. </p>
                <p>For psoriatic arthritis patients with coexistent moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, use the
                    dosing regimen for plaque psoriasis.</p>
                <p><b>Elderly patients (≥65 years)</b></p>
                <p>No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients.</p>
                <p><b>Renal impairment or hepatic impairment</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ has not been studied in these patient populations. No dosage recommendations can
                    be made.</p>
                <p><b>Method of administration</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ is for SC injection. After training in SC injection technique, a patient may self-inject
                    with ixekizumab.</p>
                <p>If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis should be avoided as injection sites.</p>
                <p>TALTZ is for single-use in one patient only. Discard any residue product.</p>
                <p><b>Special precautions for handling</b></p>
                <p>The Instructions for Use included as a pack insert must be followed carefully.</p>
                <p>Do not use TALTZ if it has been frozen.</p>


                <h4 id="Contraindications">4.3 Contraindications </h4>
                <p>TALTZ is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to ixekizumab or
                    any of the excipients.</p>

                <h4 id="Special_warnings_and_precautions_for_use">4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use </h4>
                <p><b>Infections</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ may increase the risk of infections. In clinical trials, a higher rate of infection such as
                    upper respiratory tract infection, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis and tinea infections were
                    observed in TALTZ treated patients compared to placebo <b>(see 4.8 Adverse effects
                        (Undesirable Effects)).</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ should be used with caution in patients with clinically important chronic or active
                    infection. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an
                    infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection or is not responding to standard
                    therapy the patient should be closely monitored. TALTZ should be discontinued until the
                    infection resolves.</p>

                <p>Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with TALTZ. Do
                    not administer TALTZ to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB
                    prior to administering TALTZ. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of TALTZ in
                    patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment
                    cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving TALTZ should be monitored closely for signs and
                    symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.
                </p>

                <p><b>Hypersensitivity</b></p>
                <p>Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including some cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema and
                    urticaria, have been reported. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of
                    TALTZ should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.</p>
                <p><b> Inflammatory bowel disease</b></p>
                <p>Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater
                    frequency in the TALTZ group (Crohn’s disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than the
                    placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period of the psoriasis clinical
                    trials.</p>
                <p>Exercise caution when prescribing TALTZ to patients with inflammatory bowel disease,
                    including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, as new cases or exacerbations have been
                    reported. Patients treated with TALTZ and have inflammatory bowel disease should be
                    monitored closely.</p>
                <p><b>Immunisations</b></p>
                <p>TALTZ should not be used with live vaccines. No data are available on the response to live
                    vaccines.</p>
                <p>In a study in healthy subjects, no safety concerns were identified following administration of
                    inactivated vaccines (tetanus and pneumococcal) after two doses of ixekizumab (160 mg
                    followed by a second dose of 80 mg two weeks later). However, there is insufficient data on
                    whether the immune response to these vaccines is adequate following administration of
                    TALTZ.</p>

                <p><b>Use in the elderly </b></p>
                <p>Of the 4204 psoriasis patients exposed to TALTZ in clinical trials, a total of 265 patients were
                    aged ≥65 years and 34 patients were aged ≥75 years. Of the 1118 PsA patients exposed to
                    TALTZ in clinical trials, a total of 122 patients were aged ≥65 years and 6 patients were aged
                    ≥75 years. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and
                    younger patients, the number of patients aged ≥65 years is not sufficient to determine
                    whether they respond differently from younger patients. <b>(See 5.2 Pharmacokinetic
                        properties, Special Populations, Elderly Patients (≥65 years)).</b></p>
                <p><b>Paediatric use</b></p>
                <p>Safety and effectiveness of TALTZ in paediatric patients (Less than 18 years of age) have not been
                    evaluated.</p>
                <p><b>Effects on laboratory tests</b></p>
                <p>No information on the effect of ixekizumab on laboratory tests is available.</p>


                <h4 id="Interactions_with_other_medicines_and_other_forms_of_interactions">4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions</h4>
                <p>No interaction studies have been conducted with TALTZ.</p>
                <p>The safety of ixekizumab in combination with other immunomodulatory agents or
                    phototherapy has not been evaluated.</p>
                <p><b>Cytochrome P450 Substrates</b></p>
                <p>Results from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis
                    determined that administration of ixekizumab with drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 (ie
                    midazolam), CYP2C9 (ie warfarin), CYP2C19 (ie omeprazole), CYP1A2 (ie caffeine) or
                    CYP2D6 (ie dextromethorphan) does not have a clinically significant impact on the
                    pharmacokinetics of these drugs.</p>
                <p>No interaction was seen when TALTZ was administered concomitantly with methotrexate
                    and/or corticosteroids in patients with psoriatic arthritis</p>



                <h4 id="Fertility_pregnancy_and_lactation">4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h4>
                <p><b>Effects on fertility </b></p>
                <p>The effects of ixekizumab on human fertility have not been evaluated. In animal studies,
                    ixekizumab did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility as assessed by a lack of
                    effects on reproductive organs, menstrual cycles or sperm in sexually mature cynomolgus
                    monkeys that received ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a weekly SC dose of 50 mg/kg (at least 50
                    times the human exposure at 80 mg every 2 weeks based on AUC). The monkeys were not
                    mated to evaluate fertility.</p>

                <h4><b>Use in pregnancy</b></h4>
                <p>Category C</p>

                <p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies of TALTZ in pregnant women to establish
                    the safety of TALTZ during pregnancy. The mechanism of action of ixekizumab suggests a
                    theoretical risk that its use during pregnancy may affect neonatal immunity.</p>
                <p>In developmental toxicity studies, SC administration of ixekizumab at doses up to 50 mg/kg
                    once weekly to cynomolgus monkeys from the beginning of organogenesis through either
                    near term pregnancy or until delivery of offspring, produced no embryotoxicity or
                    teratogenicity, and no effects on offspring delivery, or on morphological, functional or
                    immunological development of offspring from birth to 6 months of age. Ixekizumab was
                    shown to cross the placenta and was present in the blood of offspring for up to 6 months of
                    age.</p>
                <p>TALTZ should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential
                    risk to the foetus.</p>

                <p><b>Use in lactation </b></p>
                <p>It is not known whether ixekizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after
                    ingestion. In a pre-/postnatal development study, ixekizumab was excreted at low levels in
                    the milk of cynomolgus monkeys that had been dosed with ixekizumab during pregnancy
                    until delivery of offspring. Ixekizumab was present in the blood of offspring, due primarily to
                    placental transfer. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to
                    discontinue TALTZ, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the
                    benefit of therapy for the woman.</p>

                <h4 id="Effects_on_ability_to_drive_and_use_machines">4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines </h4>

                <p><b>Clinical trials experience in plaque psoriasis</b></p>
                <p>A total of 4204 plaque psoriasis patients were treated with TALTZ in clinical trials. Of these,
                    2190 patients were exposed to treatment with TALTZ for at least one year. </p>
                <p>Three placebo-controlled phase III trials (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3) in
                    plaque psoriasis patients were integrated to evaluate the safety of TALTZ in comparison to
                    placebo up to 12 weeks. In two of the clinical trials (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3), the safety
                    of TALTZ included a comparison to an active comparator, etanercept, up to 12 weeks after
                    treatment initiation <b>(see 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, Mechanism of Action,
                        Clinical Trials, Plaque Psoriasis)</b>. In total, 3858 patients were evaluated (1167 to TALTZ 80
                    mg every 2 weeks [Q2W], 1161 to TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W], 739 to etanercept 50
                    mg twice weekly group and 791 to placebo group).</p>
                <p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions and upper
                    respiratory tract infections (most frequently nasopharyngitis). Most of the reactions were
                    mild or moderate in severity.</p>
                <p>Adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the TALTZ
                    groups compared to the placebo group during the placebo-controlled 12 week period of
                    UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3 are summarised in Table 1.</p>

                <p>Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the placebo-controlled clinical trials
                    UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3 through to week 12 included: influenza, rhinitis,
                    conjunctivitis, urticaria and oral candidiasis.</p>
                <p>In the two clinical trials that included etanercept (UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3), the rate of
                    serious adverse events was 1.9% for both etanercept and TALTZ, and the rate of
                    discontinuation due to adverse events was 1.2% for etanercept and 2.0% for TALTZ. The rate
                    of infections was 21.5% for etanercept and 26.0% for TALTZ, with the majority of events
                    being mild to moderate in severity. The rate of serious infections was 0.4% for etanercept
                    and 0.5% for TALTZ.</p>
                <p><b>Injection site reactions</b></p>
                <p>The most frequent injection site reactions observed were erythema and pain. These reactions
                    were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of
                    TALTZ.</p>
                <p><b>Infections</b></p>
                <p>The majority of infections consisted of non-serious and mild to moderate adverse reactions
                    such as nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, which did not necessitate
                    treatment discontinuation.</p>
                <p>In the placebo-controlled period of the phase III clinical trials in plaque psoriasis, infections
                    were reported in 27.2% of patients treated with TALTZ compared with 22.9% of patients
                    treated with placebo.</p>
                <p>Serious infections occurred in 13 (0.6%) patients treated with TALTZ and in 3 (0.4%)
                    patients treated with placebo <b>(see 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use,
                        Infections)</b>. Infection-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported by more than 1 patient
                    in the TALTZ treated group were cellulitis (n=3), appendicitis (n=2) and erysipelas (n=2). </p>
                <p>The proportion of patients who discontinued due to an infection related adverse reaction
                    was similar in the total TALTZ treated group (n=8 [0.3%]) and the placebo group (n=2
                    [0.3%]).</p>
                <p>Consistent with the mechanism of action, there was an increase in oral candidiasis. All, except
                    one case, were mild or moderate in severity. No SAEs or discontinuations from treatment due
                    to candidiasis were reported.</p>

                <p>Overall, infections were reported in 52.8% of patients treated with TALTZ (46.9 per 100
                    patient years) and serious infections were reported in 1.6% of patients treated with TALTZ
                    (1.5 per 100 patient years).</p>
                <p><b>Laboratory Assessment of Neutropenia</b></p>
                <p>Neutropenia was observed in clinical trials. In general, neutropenia was transient and did not
                    require discontinuation of TALTZ, and was not associated with an increased rate of
                    infections. In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials, neutropenia ≥ Grade 3 (Less than 1,000
                    cells/mm3) was observed infrequently (0.1%) in patients receiving TALTZ compared to
                    etanercept (0.5%) and placebo (0.1%). The remaining cases of neutropenia were low grade,
                    either Grade 2 (2.0% for TALTZ, 3.3% for etanercept and 0.3% for placebo; ≥1,000 to less than 1,500
                    cells/mm3) or Grade 1 (5.7% for TALTZ, 9.0% for etanercept and 2.3% for placebo; ≥1,500
                    cells/mm3 up to normal).</p>

                <p><b>Clinical trials experience in psoriatic arthritis</b></p>
                <p>A total of 779 patients with active psoriatic arthritis were evaluated in two placebocontrolled phase III clinical trials SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 (229 patients on TALTZ 80 mg
                    every 4 weeks (Q4W), 225 patients on TALTZ 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 101 patients on
                    adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks and 224 patients on placebo). </p>

                    the placebo-controlled clinical trials SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 through to week 24 included
                    tinea and urticaria.</p>
                <p>During the 24-week placebo-controlled period of SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-2, the proportion of
                    patients with treatment-emergent adverse events was higher in the TALTZ 80 mg Q4W group
                    compared to the placebo group (67% and 57%, respectively). The rate of SAEs was 3.9%
                    (TALTZ 80mg Q4W), 4.9% (TALTZ 80mg Q2W), 2.7% (placebo), and the discontinuation due
                    to adverse events were 3.1% (TALTZ 80mg Q4W), 5.3% (TALTZ 80mg Q2W), 3.6% (placebo).</p>
                <p><b>Infections</b></p>
                <p>In the double-blind treatment period of the phase III clinical studies in psoriatic arthritis,
                    infections were reported in 32.8% of patients treated with TALTZ for up to 24 weeks
                    compared with 27.7% of patients treated with placebo. The majority of infections were nonserious and mild to moderate in severity, most of which did not necessitate treatment
                    discontinuation. Serious infections occurred in 1.3% of patients treated with TALTZ and in
                    0% of patients treated with placebo. Over the entire ixekizumab exposure treatment period,
                    infections were reported in 37.2% of patients treated with TALTZ (39.6 per 100 patient
                    years). Serious infections were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with TALTZ (1.4 per 100
                    patient years).</p>

                <p><b>Laboratory Assessment of Neutropenia</b></p>
                <p>In psoriatic arthritis studies, 1.9% of patients receiving TALTZ developed neutropenia. In
                    most cases, the blood neutrophil count was ≥1,000 cells/mm3. Such levels of neutropenia
                    may persist, fluctuate or be transient. 0.3% of patients receiving TALTZ developed a
                    neutrophil count les than 1000 cells/mm3. In general, neutropenia did not require discontinuation
                    of TALTZ.</p>

                <p><b>Immunogenicity</b></p>
                <p>In the psoriasis clinical trials, approximately 9% to 17% of patients treated with TALTZ at the
                    recommended dosing regimen developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of which were
                    low titres and not associated with reduced clinical response up to 60 weeks of treatment.
                    However, approximately 1% of patients treated with TALTZ had confirmed neutralising
                    antibodies associated with low drug concentrations and reduced clinical response. </p>
                <p>In psoriatic arthritis patients treated with ixekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen
                    up to 52 weeks, approximately 11% (n = 12) developed anti-drug antibodies, the majority of
                    which were low titre. Approximately 8% (n = 8) had confirmed neutralising antibodies,
                    which were first detected at Week 24 (n=2), Week 32 (n=2), Week 36 (n=3) and Week 52
                    (n=1). No apparent association between the presence of neutralising antibodies and impact
                    on drug concentration or efficacy was observed.</p>
                <p>An association between immunogenicity and treatment emergent adverse events has not

                        <p><b>Mechanism of action</b></p>
                        <p>Ixekizumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity (Less than 3 pM) to IL-17A, a
                            proinflammatory cytokine. Ixekizumab does not bind to ligands IL-17B, IL 17C, IL-17D, IL17E or IL-17F. Elevated levels of IL-17A have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety
                            of autoimmune diseases. In psoriasis, the IL-17A ligand plays a major role in driving excess
                            keratinocyte proliferation and activation. Neutralisation of IL-17A by ixekizumab inhibits
                            these actions. </p>
                        <p>In vitro binding assays showed that ixekizumab does not bind to human Fcγ receptors I, IIa
                            and IIIa or to complement component C1q and is therefore not expected to elicit Fc-receptor
                            mediated effects (e.g., antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement system
                            activation).</p>
                        <p><b>Pharmacodynamics</b></p>
                        <p>Ixekizumab modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by IL-17A.</p>
                        <p>Healthy individuals who received ixekizumab had similar antibody responses 1 month after
                            vaccination with tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines compared to individuals who did not
                            receive ixekizumab. The clinical effectiveness of vaccines has not been assessed in patients
                            undergoing treatment with ixekizumab.</p>


                        <p><b>Clinical trials</b></p>

                        <p>The efficacy and safety of TALTZ were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase III clinical trials in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis
                            who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy (UNCOVER-1 [RHAZ], UNCOVER2 [RHBA] and UNCOVER-3 [RHBC]). Patients were ≥18 years of age with plaque psoriasis
                            who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10%, a static Physician Global
                            Assessment (sPGA) score of ≥3 and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥12.
                            Patients with guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis were excluded from clinical trials.</p>
                        <p>The efficacy and safety of TALTZ were also evaluated compared to etanercept (UNCOVER-2
                            and UNCOVER-3). Patients randomised to TALTZ who were responders (sPGA 0 (clear) or 1
                            (minimal) at Week 12) were re-randomised to receive TALTZ or placebo for an additional 48
                            weeks (UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2). Patients randomised to placebo, etanercept or TALTZ
                            who were non-responders (sPGA ≥1 at Week 12) received TALTZ for up to 48 weeks.</p>

                        <p>Of the 3866 patients enrolled in the placebo-controlled trials, 64% had received prior
                            systemic therapy (biologic, conventional systemic or PUVA), 43.5% had received prior
                            phototherapy, 49.3% had received prior conventional systemic therapy and 26.4% had
                            received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of all patients, 14.9% had
                            received at least one anti-TNF alpha agent and 8.7% had received an anti-IL-12/IL-23. A total
                            of 23.4% of patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis.</p>
                        <p>In all three clinical trials, the primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who
                            achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and an
                            sPGA (0,1) with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline. The sPGA is a 6 category scale
                            ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe) that indicates the physician’s overall assessment of
                            psoriasis based on plaque thickness/induration, erythema and scaling.</p>

                        <p>Other evaluated outcomes included the proportion of patients with a sPGA 0, a reduction of
                            at least 90% in PASI (PASI 90), a reduction of 100% in PASI (PASI 100) and an improvement
                            of itch severity as measured by an Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS).</p>
                        <p>Patients in all treatment groups had a median baseline PASI score ranging from
                            approximately 17.4 to 18.3. Baseline sPGA score was severe or very severe in 51.2% of
                            patients in UNCOVER-1, 49.7% in UNCOVER-2 and 48.3% in UNCOVER-3.</p>

                        <p>UNCOVER-1 enrolled 1296 patients, randomised to receive either TALTZ (80 mg every two
                            or four weeks [Q2W or Q4W]) following a 160 mg starting dose (two injections) at Week 0, or

                        <p>The TALTZ 80 mg Q2W dose regimen provided superior efficacy (p Less than 0.001) at Week 12
                            across all endpoints for all three clinical trials. Further, all TALTZ treatment groups
                            consistently demonstrated superiority to placebo and to etanercept in achieving high rates of
                            response (PASI 90) and complete resolution of psoriatic plaque (PASI 100). Further, TALTZ
                            treatment groups had significantly greater improvements in itch severity, as early as Week 1
                            compared to placebo and to etanercept (p Less than 0.001). The percentage of patients achieving a
                            sPGA 0 (clear) or 1 (minimal) was statistically significant compared to placebo as early as

                        <p>TALTZ was associated with a fast onset of efficacy with >50% reduction in mean PASI by
                            Week 2 (Figure 1). The percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 was significantly greater for
                            TALTZ compared with placebo and etanercept as early as Week 1. Approximately 25% of
                            patients treated with TALTZ achieved a PASI score less than 5 by Week 2, more than 55% achieved

                        <p>TALTZ was efficacious in systemic treatment-naïve, biologic-naïve, biologic/anti-TNFexposed and biologic/anti-TNF-failure patients. Improvements in sPGA and PASI endpoints
                            in patients with concurrent psoriatic arthritis at baseline were similar to those in the overall

                        <p>To evaluate the maintenance of response, patients originally randomised to TALTZ and who
                            were responders at Week 12 (sPGA 0,1) in UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2 trials, were rerandomised to an additional 48 weeks of one of the following treatment regimens: TALTZ 80
                            mg Q4W, TALTZ 80 mg Q12W or placebo. Patients who were non-responders (sPGA >1) at
                            Week 12 and who relapsed (sPGA ≥3) during the maintenance period were placed on TALTZ

                        <p>For responders at Week 12, the percentage of patients who maintained this response at
                            Week 60 was higher for patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W (71%) compared to those
                            treated with TALTZ 80 mg Q12W (35.5%) or placebo (7%). Further, of the responders at
                            Week 12 who were treated with maintenance Q4W dosing, the proportion who maintained
                            or achieved complete resolution of psoriatic plaques at Week 60 as measured by a sPGA (0)
                            or PASI 100 was 52.0% and 51.4%, respectively. Additionally, 76.4% of patients achieved or

                        <p>In the UNCOVER-2 clinical trial, patients identified as non-responder to etanercept (sPGA >1
                            at Week 12) were switched to TALTZ 80 mg Q4W after a 4-week washout period (N=200). Of
                            these, 73% and 83.5% of patients were able to achieve sPGA (0,1) and PASI 75, respectively,
                            after 12 weeks treatment with TALTZ. In the subset of etanercept non-responders who were
                            biologic-naïve at baseline (N=154), the sPGA (0,1) and PASI 75 after 12 weeks of treatment
                            with TALTZ were consistent (72.7% and 83.8%, respectively) with the overall etanercept
                            non-responder population.</p>
                        <p><b>Quality of Life</b></p>
                        <p>Across all clinical trials at Week 12, TALTZ was associated with statistically significant
                            improvement in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as measured by the Dermatology Life
                            Quality Index (DLQI). A DLQI (0,1) indicates no impact of psoriasis on quality of life. A
                            significantly greater proportion of patients treated with TALTZ achieved a DLQI (0,1)
                            compared with patients treated with placebo or etanercept, with higher response rates for

                        <p>Across all treatments, patients who achieved sPGA (0) at Week 12 reported higher rates of
                            DLQI (0,1) than patients who achieved sPGA (0,1), who likewise had higher DLQI (0,1)
                            response rates than patients who achieved sPGA (>1). Similarly, each incremental increase in
                            PASI was associated with greater responses of DLQI (0,1). For patients who achieved
                            complete resolution of their psoriasis at 12 weeks, 82% reported that their psoriasis no
                            longer had impact on their HRQoL (see Figure 2).</p>

                        <p>The statistically significant superior benefit of TALTZ over placebo and etanercept was seen

                        <p><b>Absorption</b></p>
                        <p>Following a single SC dose of ixekizumab in patients with psoriasis, mean peak
concentrations were achieved within 4 to 7 days across a dose range of 5 mg to 160 mg. The
mean (SD) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ixekizumab, after the 160 mg starting
dose, was 19.9 (8.15) microgram/mL.</p>
                        <p>After the 160 mg starting dose, steady state was achieved by Week 8 with the ixekizumab 80
mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) dosing regimen. Mean (SD) Cmax,ss and Ctrough,ss estimates are 21.5
(9.16) microgram/mL and 5.23 (3.19) microgram/mL, respectively. After switching from the
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen to the ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W)
dosing regimen at Week 12, steady state would be achieved after approximately 10 weeks.
Mean (SD) Cmax,ss and Ctrough,ss estimates are 14.6 (6.04) microgram/mL and 1.87 (1.30)
microgram/mL, respectively.</p>
                        <p>The average SC bioavailability of ixekizumab was estimated in the range of 54% to 90%
across analyses.</p>

                        <p><b>Distribution</b></p>
                        <p>From population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean total volume of distribution at steadystate was 7.11 L.</p>

                        <p><b>Metabolism</b></p>
                        <p>Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small peptides and
                            amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs.</p>

                        <p><b>Excretion</b></p>
                        <p>In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, mean serum clearance was 0.0161 L/hour.
Clearance is independent of dose. The mean elimination half-life is 13 days in plaque
psoriasis patients. Ixekizumab clearance increases as body weight increases.</p>
                        <p><b>Dose proportionality</b></p>
                        <p>Exposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a dose range of 5 mg to 160 mg given as a SC
injection.</p>

                        <p>Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis with limited number of elderly patients (N=82
for ≥65 years and N=7 for ≥75 years), clearance of ixekizumab in elderly patients was similar
to patients aged less than 65 years</p>
                        <p><i>Renal Impairment or Hepatic Impairment</i></p>
                        <p>Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ixekizumab have not been conducted.</p>
